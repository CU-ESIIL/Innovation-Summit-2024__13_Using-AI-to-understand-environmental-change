# Group 13 -- Using AI to understand environmental change 

!!! Success "Provocative question"

    How can AI be leveraged to understand environmental changes and predict ecosystem responses?

## Day 2 Report Back
Day 2 report-back questions are about the team *process*. We are interested in your team’s unique experience. Below are some prompts you might consider. You don't need to address all of them - choose which ones you want to present. Please limit your reflection to 2-3 mins.  

1. **What worked well for your team?**
     - Consensus
     - Team work
     - Communication
     - Sturcture
     - Interesting project idea which stemmed from collaboration
     - We learnt a lot!
3. **What’s one thing you would change?**
     - We had good ideas, but not enough time to implement them in the way we wanted
     - Keeping a throughline
     - More realistic scoping to allow time to create tangible results
     - Get into complex tasks/systems more efficiently
5. **Did your group ever have an “ah-ha” moment?  What led up to that moment?**
     - We were on course to get there but needed more time
     - More data exploration = future ah-ha moment??
7. **Did your group experience the groan zone?  What is one tip you want to share with future groups at the Summit about getting through the groan zone?**
     - Yes! We hit the scoping/brainstorming groan zone on day 1, and are entered the data exploration/understanding groan zone
     - What helped?: Simplification --> pushing towards convergence in order to move things along
