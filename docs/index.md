# Group 13 -- Using AI to understand environmental change 

!!! Success "Provocative question"

    How can AI be leveraged to understand environmental changes and predict ecosystem responses?

## Day 3 Report Back
- **Project Title:**
    - Wildfire AI
- **Research Question:**
    - How do wildfire severity, human activity, and environmental factors effect water quality downstream from fire sites?
 
Motivation: Using machine learning (AI) approaches to answer novel, difficult questions about how combined factors influence key ecosystem metrics is an important aspect of understanding complex environmental systems. Understanding these systems is crucial to managing them sustainably and increasing their resilience. Machine learning offers an approach to model and understand these complexities, paving the way for action. 

- **One interesting graphic/finding:**

*Next technical step: use hydrological data to find water sampling sites that are downstream of fire sites*


- **What are you thinking about doing next with your team? Long-term, short-term?**
    - *Short term*:
    - Slack channel
    - 1 pager for ESIIL newsletter
    - *Long term*:
    - Published paper
- **Whatâ€™s missing: what resources, people, data sets, etc. does your team need?**
    - Time!
    - More training and/or expertise on tech systems/infrastructure
    - Human impact data, land cover before 2000
