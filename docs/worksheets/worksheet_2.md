## Research Question: Innovation for Inclusion or Computation (approx. time: 5-10 mins)
Write the research question your team selected in the space below. Feel free to revise the original question.

- How do wildfire severity, human activity, and environmental factors effect water quality downstream from fire sites?


## Project Title (approx. time: 5-10 mins)
Craft a catchy title for your team’s project. Think of something that would grab attention at a conference or in a headline.

- Wildfire AI 


## Promoting Resilience and Adaptation
Describe how your proposed project aligns with the Summit's themes of resilience and adaptation. Please provide 1-2 sentences that clearly connect your project's goals or methods to these themes.

- Using machine learning (AI) approaches to answer novel, difficult questions about how combined factors influence key ecosystem metrics is an important aspect of understanding complex environmental systems. Understanding these systems is crucial to managing them sustainably and increasing their resilience. Machine learning offers an approach to model and understand these complexities, paving the way for action. (PLEASE REVISE AS YOU SEE FIT - I'M TIRED)


## Choosing Big Data Sets
Explore potential data sets for your project's topic from the [data library](https://cu-esiil.github.io/data-library/). List your options below, organizing them by whether they represent the system you're studying (e.g., deciduous forests) or the disruption to it (e.g., wildfire). Then discuss your choices and indicate your final selections.

### Draft Potential Data Sets
  - **System Being Perturbed/Disrupted:**
    - *Water*:
    - USGS Stream Gauge data - water quality
    - DB Hydro (is this only for Florida?)
  - **Perturbator/Disrupter:**
    - *Fire - severity, DNBI/DNBR*:
    - In general, comparing remote sensing data from before and after the fire
    - *Fire - extent*:
    - MTBS (Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity)
    - FIRED
    - National Interagency Fire Center - active/live fires as well as historical data
    - *Water*:
    - USGS Stream Guage data
    - DB Hydro
    - *Human activity*:
    - NLCD (National land cover database)
    - *Other*:
    - Looking for meteorological, soil, vegetation (NDVI), ecosystem type
   
Severity - how it affects the area (this is the metric we want)
Intensity - how hot the fire burned

### Final Choice
  - **System Being Perturbed/Disrupted (Final Choice):**
    - USGS Stream Gauge data - for water quality
    - NHD (National Hydrologic Dataset) - for river confluences and boundaries
  - **Perturbator/Disrupter (Final Choice):**
    - MTBS - for burn severity



## Brief Check-in: Definition of Resilience (approx. 5 mins)
Below is a working definition of the word "Resilience" for the Summit. Please edit the definition below based on your earlier discussion and chosen project.

*"Resilience is the capacity of a system, community, organization, or individual to absorb stress, recover from disruptions, adapt to change, and continue to develop and thrive."*

- [Edit or reaffirm this definition here]


## Day 1 Report Back
Select one representative from your group to present your proposed project. For the report back, each group will have 30-60 seconds to present their responses to the questions below. Keep it concise and focused. This is just a quick oral presentation - you will not be able to use slides/images.

- **Project Title:**
  - Wildfire AI
- **Research Question:**
  - How do wildfire severity, human activity, and environmental factors effect water quality downstream from fire sites?
- **Selected Data Sets:**
  - Still finalizing
