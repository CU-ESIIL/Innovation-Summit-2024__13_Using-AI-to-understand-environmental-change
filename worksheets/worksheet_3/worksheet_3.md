# TEAM ACTIVITY 2: Innovate as a Team

Welcome back! We hope today is a productive day getting to know your team and coding.

## Day 2 summary: 
Please complete the warm-up with your team, briefly review today’s objectives, and carefully read the Day 2 and Day 3 report out items to guide your efforts.  

## Objectives for Day 2
1. Work together to decide on the data sets you will use. Reminder: Use a decision-making technique discussed during Day 1. Kaner’s Gradient of Agreement is below for reference.
2. Practice joining your datasets together. 
3. Discuss and try creating interesting graphics.
4. Report back on your results at the end of the day. Today’s report back is short and focused on your team process. The Day 3 report back is more detailed. 


## Morning Warm-up
Please share the following informaton with your team. (No need to write down your responses this time)
- Name
- Pronouns
- Reflecting on Day 1, what is something that surprised you?

## Decision-Making
Use the gradient of agreement (Kaner 20214) to make decisions as a team.

## Day 2 Report Back
Day 2 report-back questions are about the team *process*. We are interested in your team’s unique experience. Below are some prompts you might consider. You don't need to address all of them - choose which ones you want to present. Please limit your reflection to 2-3 mins.  

1. **What worked well for your team?**
     - Consensus
     - Team work
     - Communication
     - Sturcture
     - Interesting project idea which stemmed from collaboration
     - We learnt a lot!
3. **What’s one thing you would change?**
     - We had good ideas, but not enough time to implement them in the way we wanted
     - Keeping a throughline
     - More realistic scoping to allow time to create tangible results
     - Get into complex tasks/systems more efficiently
5. **Did your group ever have an “ah-ha” moment?  What led up to that moment?**
     - We were on course to get there but needed more time
     - More data exploration = future ah-ha moment??
7. **Did your group experience the groan zone?  What is one tip you want to share with future groups at the Summit about getting through the groan zone?**
     - Yes! We hit the scoping/brainstorming groan zone on day 1, and are entered the data exploration/understanding groan zone
     - What helped?: Simplification --> pushing towards convergence in order to move things along

### Looking Ahead: Day 3 Report Back
*These are the prompts for the final Report Back **tomorrow (Day 3)** - start thinking about these questions as you work today. Each group will share their Day 3 GitHub page on the screen and give a 4 minute presentation.*

- **Project Title:**
- Wildfire AI
- **Research Question:**
- How do wildfire severity, human activity, and environmental factors effect water quality downstream from fire sites?
- **One interesting graphic/finding:**

  (Not interesting, but it is technically a graphic)
- **What are you thinking about doing next with your team? Long-term, short-term?**
- *Short term*:
- Slack channel
- 1 pager for ESIIL newsletter
- *Long term*:
- Published paper
- **What’s missing: what resources, people, data sets, etc. does your team need?**
- Time!
- More training and/or expertise on tech systems/infrastructure
- Human impact data, land cover before 2000
      
### Reminder
There is the opportunity for groups to continue working on their projects as an ESIIL Working Group. If you love your team and want to continue working together, considering submitting a Working Group Application this fall. See the ESIIL website for more information: <https://esiil.org/working-groups>.
